## Session: April 24, 2026 — Smart Semantic Search & UI Enhancements

### 1. Smart Semantic Search (Gemini + pgvector)
- Integrated `pgvector` into the PostgreSQL database via Prisma for vector embeddings (`ivfflat` index).
- Created a two-layer search architecture:
  - **Layer A (Alias Dictionary)**: Instantly expands queries using a local synonym map (e.g., `ps5` ↔ `playstation`).
  - **Layer B (Semantic Fallback)**: Uses Google Gemini (`gemini-embedding-2`, 768 dimensions) to perform cosine distance semantic searches if keyword search returns few results.
- Added background job/hook to autonomously generate embeddings on product creation.
- Built a backfill script (`scripts/seedTestData.ts` / `scripts/backfillEmbeddings.ts`) to populate embeddings for test data.

### 2. Fuzzy Spell Correction & Autocomplete
- Built `fuzzySearch.ts` utilizing Levenshtein distance for typo correction.
- Automated a 5-minute background process to refresh the search vocabulary from the database.
- Created `/api/search/suggestions` endpoint for real-time autocomplete.
- Updated frontend (`Search.tsx`) with an interactive suggestions dropdown and a "Showing results for..." spell-correction banner.

### 3. Category-Aware Filtering
- Built `categoryInference.ts` to map search terms to specific categories (Electronics, Food, Beauty, Fashion, Grocery).
- Integrated with Gemini for AI-driven category extraction.
- Completely isolated cross-category noise (e.g., searching "phone" strictly returns Electronics, preventing Food matches).

### 4. Map Bottom Sheet Redesign
- Redesigned the "Stores near you" panel in `Map.tsx` into a modern, upward-expanding bottom sheet.
- Added horizontal scrolling store profile cards in the collapsed state.
- Refined the expanded state with a pinned top header, scrollable white container, and removed arbitrary rank numbers.

### 5. Housekeeping
- Configured `.gitignore` to exclude local `uploads/` directory to prevent binary bloat in version control.
- Created robust test data environment with `npm run seed:test`.
