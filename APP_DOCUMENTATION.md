## Overview

G-AI is a **local retail discovery platform** connecting customers with nearby retailers, suppliers, brands, and manufacturers. Users can browse stores, follow them, view posts/products, chat with businesses, write reviews, and get real-time notifications.

There are two separate front-end apps:
- **Main App** (`/`) — for end users (customers, retailers, suppliers, brands, manufacturers)
- **Admin Panel** (`admin.*`) — for platform administrators

Both share a single **Express + TypeScript backend** (`server.ts`).

## Architecture

```
Internet
   │
Nginx (port 80/443)
   ├── yourdomain.com  → serves /dist (React build) + proxies /api/ and /socket.io/ to Node
   ├── admin.yourdomain.com → serves /admin-panel/dist + proxies /api/ and /socket.io/ to Node
   └── /uploads/       → served directly by Nginx (no Node.js hit)
         │
    Node.js (port 3000, PM2 cluster — one process per CPU core)
         ├── Express REST API
         ├── Socket.IO server (Redis adapter syncs across all workers)
         ├── BullMQ workers (background notifications)
         └── Prisma → PostgreSQL
                    └── Redis (cache, rate limit, pub/sub, job queue)
```

## Database Models

| Model | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `User` | All accounts — customers, retailers, suppliers, brands, manufacturers, admins |
| `Store` | Business profile created by a retailer/supplier/brand/manufacturer after KYC approval |
| `Product` | Products listed under a store |
| `Post` | Photo posts by a store (image + caption + price, optionally linked to a product) |
| `Message` | Direct messages between users |
| `Follow` | User following a store |
| `Review` | Star rating + comment on a store or product |
| `Notification` | In-app notifications for users |
| `SavedItem` | Saved posts or stores by a user |
| `SearchHistory` | Recent searches per user |
| `SavedLocation` | Pinned locations on the map |
| `TeamMember` | Store team accounts (max 3 per store, separate login from main User) |
| `Report` | User-submitted reports against users or stores |
| `Complaint` | Support tickets submitted by users |
| `Like` | Post likes |
| `Category` | Product/store categories |
| `AppSettings` | Global app config (name, logo, colors, carousel images) — singleton row |

### Key field notes
- `Post.isOpeningPost` — the store's main photo; always displayed first, never expires
- `Post.isPinned` — pinned by store owner; shown after opening post
- `Post.expiryDate` — regular posts expire 30 days after creation unless promoted
- `User.kycStatus` — `none | pending | approved | rejected`
- `Store.chatEnabled` — owner can disable chat
- `Store.hideRatings` — owner can hide public ratings

## User Roles

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| `customer` | Browse, follow, chat, review, save |
| `retailer` | Own a retail store, post products/photos |
| `supplier` | Own a supplier store |
| `brand` | Own a brand store |
| `manufacturer` | Own a manufacturer store |
| `admin` | Full access to admin panel |

Non-customer roles (retailer, supplier, brand, manufacturer) must complete KYC before their store is created.

## Real-time (Socket.IO)

- Server uses **Redis adapter** so events work correctly across all PM2 cluster workers
- Each user joins their own room (`socket.join(userId)`) on connect
- **Events emitted by server:**
  - `newMessage` — sent to both sender and receiver room when a message is created
  - `newNotification` — sent to a user room when a notification is created
- **Client usage in Chat.tsx:** connects with JWT auth token, listens for `newMessage`

---

## File Uploads

- **Local mode** (default): files stored in `/uploads/` directory, served by Nginx directly
- **S3 mode**: set `S3_BUCKET_NAME`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION` env vars
- Max file size: 5MB
- Allowed types: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, Excel (.xlsx, .xls)
- Nginx serves `/uploads/` directly with 30-day cache headers (bypasses Node.js)

---

## Rate Limiting

All limits are Redis-backed (survive restarts, shared across cluster workers).

| Limiter | Routes | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| `generalLimiter` | All `/api/*` | 300 req/min per IP |
| `authLimiter` | `/api/login`, `/api/users` | 20 req / 15 min per IP |
| `uploadLimiter` | `/api/upload` | 10 req/min per IP |
| `messageLimiter` | `/api/messages` | 30 req/min per IP |

---

## Caching (Redis)

| Cache Key | TTL | What |
|---|---|---|
| `feed:{role}:p{page}:l{limit}` | 30s | Discovery feed per role + page |
| `search:{role}:{query}` | 60s | Search results per role + query |
| `blocked:{userId}` | 60s | User blocked status (avoids DB hit per request) |
| `team:{teamMemberId}` | 120s | Team member existence check |

---

## Background Jobs (BullMQ)

Queue name: `Notifications`

| Job | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `publishPostNotifications` | New post created | Creates `NEW_POST` notifications for all store followers in 1000-record chunks; emits `newNotification` to online users |
| `autoReply` | First message sent to a store | Sends an automated reply from the store owner |

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Required
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://g_ai_user:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/g_ai
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
JWT_SECRET=your-long-random-secret-here-minimum-32-chars

# Admin account seeding — both required for admin account to be created on startup
ADMIN_PHONE=your-admin-phone-number
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-admin-password

# Optional
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://admin.yourdomain.com

# File uploads — only needed for S3 mode
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

Admin panel (`.env` in `admin-panel/`):
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

Main app (`.env` in root for Vite):
```env
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-key
```

---

## Deployment

One-command deploy on fresh Ubuntu 22.04 VPS:

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh && ./deploy.sh
```

The script installs: Node.js 22, PostgreSQL 14, Redis, Nginx, Certbot (SSL), PM2, clones the repo, runs `npm ci`, runs Prisma migrations, builds both frontends, configures Nginx, gets SSL certificate, and starts the app with PM2.

**After deploy**, create `.env` at `/var/www/g-ai/.env` with the variables above.

### Process Management (PM2)
- Cluster mode: one worker per CPU core
- Auto-restart on crash or if memory exceeds 1GB per worker
- Logs: `/var/log/g-ai/out.log` and `/var/log/g-ai/error.log`
